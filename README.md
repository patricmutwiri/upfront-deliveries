Building
========

We have a Grunt build file which will create the Fabrik package for you, and place it in a folder /fabrik_build
The build relies on node-gpy, which depending on your operating system may require additional installations beyond node itself.
Please follow the instructions @ https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp
 
Once done you should be able open a command prompt (best to run as administrator in Windows) and then do

> npm install
> Grunt

An additional tasks is available for minimising the javascript:

> Grunt js
