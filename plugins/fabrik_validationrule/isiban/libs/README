This library is from:

https://github.com/globalcitizen/php-iban

At some point, we will add this to the Composer dependencies for Fabrik, but the full library is
quite large, and all we really need are two files - php-iban.php and registry.txt.  So until we have
moved the Fabrik optional library files into their own install package, so size isn't an issue,
we'll just include these files in the plugin's own ./libs folder.

To update, just download the latest version of php-iban, and copy those two files into this folder.

Version at time of writing is 2.5.9, October 2016.
